# Files to Delete

The following files can be sourced from the template repository (trfore/docker-image) and safely deleted:

- deploy_docker_hub.yml
- update_base_digest.yml
- test_systemd.yml
- template_files_to_delete.md (this document)

```sh
# delete in downstream repositories
rm deploy_docker_hub.yml update_base_digest.yml test_systemd.yml template_files_to_delete.md
```
